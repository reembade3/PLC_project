Project Name: Custom Programming Language Concept

Overview
This project aims to explore the fundamental concepts of programming languages by creating a custom programming language and implementing it within a Visual Studio environment. The language is designed to have its own syntax and lexical rules, which will be tested using a graphical user interface (GUI) for code input and analysis.

Features
Custom Syntax: The programming language has a unique syntax designed to showcase various language features and concepts.
Visual Studio Integration: The project is implemented within the Visual Studio environment, providing a familiar IDE for development and testing.
GUI Interface: The GUI includes textboxes for code input and error display, making it easy to enter code and view any lexical analysis errors.
Lexical Analysis: The system performs lexical analysis on the entered code, identifying tokens and potential syntax errors.
Components
Custom Language Parser: A parser is developed to interpret the custom syntax of the programming language.
Lexical Analyzer: Responsible for breaking the input code into tokens and identifying lexical errors.
GUI Form: Provides the interface for entering code and displaying analysis results.
Error Handler: Manages the detection and display of lexical errors encountered during analysis.
How to Use
Opening the Project: Open the project in Visual Studio.
GUI Interface: Run the application to access the GUI interface.
Enter Code: Use the provided textbox to enter code written in the custom programming language.
Lexical Analysis: Click on the analysis button to initiate lexical analysis.
Error Display: Any lexical errors found will be displayed in the error list box.
Debugging: Review the error messages to identify and debug any issues in the code
