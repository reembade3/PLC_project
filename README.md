# My Programming Language Concept Project

## Introduction
This project aims to explore the creation of a new programming language, including defining its syntax, implementing it in Visual Studio, and incorporating features such as a form for code input, error handling, and lexical analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Syntax Definition**: Define the syntax rules for the programming language.
- **Visual Studio Integration**: Implement the language in Visual Studio for testing and development.
- **Form Design**: Create a form with text boxes for code input and error display, and incorporate lexical analysis.

## Syntax Definition
The syntax of the programming language is crucial for defining its structure and rules. It includes elements such as keywords, operators, identifiers, and control structure.
